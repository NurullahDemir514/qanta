## Coding Standards

### Dart/Flutter Best Practices
- Use `const` constructors whenever possible
- Prefer `final` over `var` for immutable variables
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow Dart naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)
- Always use `super.key` for widget constructors
- Use `late` keyword appropriately for non-nullable variables

### Widget Guidelines
- Create reusable widgets in `shared/widgets/`
- Use `StatelessWidget` when possible, `StatefulWidget` only when state is needed
- Implement proper `dispose()` methods for controllers and streams
- Use `Builder` widgets to access context when needed
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### State Management
- Use Provider for global state (theme, user data)
- Use local state (setState) for simple UI state
- Create separate providers for different concerns
- Use `Consumer` and `Selector` widgets appropriately
- Implement proper error handling in providers

### Navigation
- Use GoRouter for all navigation
- Define routes in `routes/app_router.dart`
- Use named routes instead of direct navigation
- Implement proper route guards for authentication

### Styling & Theming
- Use Material 3 design system
- Follow the established color scheme (#00FFB3 mint green primary)
- Use Google Fonts Sora throughout the app
- Implement responsive design with MediaQuery
- Use Theme.of(context) for colors and text styles
- Support both light and dark themes

### Localization
- Add all user-facing strings to ARB files
- Use descriptive keys for localization
- Support Turkish and English languages
- Use AppLocalizations.of(context) for translations

### File Naming
- Use snake_case for file names
- Use descriptive names that reflect functionality
- Group related files in appropriate modules
- Use suffixes: `_page.dart`, `_widget.dart`, `_provider.dart`, `_model.dart`

### Code Organization
- Keep files under 300 lines when possible
- Separate business logic from UI
- Use barrel exports (index.dart) for modules
- Group imports: Flutter, packages, relative imports
- Use meaningful comments for complex logic

### Error Handling
- Implement try-catch blocks for async operations
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Log errors appropriately (debugPrint in development)
- Handle network connectivity issues
- Validate user inputs

### Performance
- Use `const` widgets to reduce rebuilds
- Implement lazy loading for lists
- Optimize images and assets
- Use `ListView.builder` for large lists
- Avoid unnecessary rebuilds with proper state management

### Security
- Never commit API keys or sensitive data
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow Supabase security best practices
- Use secure storage for sensitive data

### Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Write widget tests for UI components
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for good test coverage

## Finance App Specific Guidelines

### Data Models
- Create models for: User, Transaction, Card, Budget, Category
- Use proper data validation
- Implement serialization methods (toJson/fromJson)
- Use enums for transaction types, categories

### Financial Calculations
- Use `Decimal` or `BigDecimal` for precise calculations
- Handle currency formatting properly
- Implement proper rounding for financial values
- Support multiple currencies

### UI/UX for Finance
- Use clear visual hierarchy for financial data
- Implement proper loading states
- Show confirmation dialogs for important actions
- Use appropriate icons for financial concepts
- Implement pull-to-refresh for data updates

### Security for Finance
- Implement biometric authentication
- Use secure storage for sensitive financial data
- Implement session timeouts
- Add transaction confirmation steps
- Log financial operations for audit

## AI Integration Guidelines
- Use clear prompts for AI financial insights
- Implement proper error handling for AI responses
- Show loading states during AI processing
- Cache AI responses when appropriate
- Provide fallback content when AI is unavailable

## Git Workflow
- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Create feature branches for new functionality
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Use pull requests for code review

## Dependencies Management
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use specific version numbers in pubspec.yaml
- Document why each dependency is needed
- Prefer official packages over third-party when possible
- Regular security audits of dependencies

## Documentation
- Document complex business logic
- Keep README.md updated
- Document API integrations
- Maintain changelog for releases
- Document deployment procedures
